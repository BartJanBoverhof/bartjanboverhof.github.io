      <description>My name is Bart-Jan. Iâ€™m graduated student of Metdodology and Statistics at Utrecht University. My interest mostly lies in machine learning &amp;amp; deep-learning. I very much enjoy to disentangle a certain subject: something to which research in the fields of statistics &amp;amp; data science lends itself perfectly. This rabbit-hole like nature implies that there is always something more to learn.
My intrest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University.</description>
