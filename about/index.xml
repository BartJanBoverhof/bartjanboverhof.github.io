      <description>I am PhD candidate at the Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp;amp; Management at Erasmus University. My research interests are in the evaluation of clinical Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, AI in general and Statistics
This interest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University. Whilst studying Sociology, I already quickly realised that statistics sparked my interest the most. Luckily, my program allowed for a lot of freedom with regards to electives, which led me to take quite a bit of statistics courses.</description>
