      <description>I am Bart-Jan. I’m a graduate student of methodology and statistics at Utrecht University. My interest mostly lies in machine-learning, or more specifically, deep-learning. I highly enjoy to disentangle a certain subject. Statistical research lends itself perfectly for getting to the bottom of stuff. This rabbit-hole like nature implies that there is always something more. When you think you finally know it all, something new appears on the horizon.
My intrest in statistics was initially kindled as undergraduate Sociology student at Utrecht University.</description>
